            Basketball is a fast-paced and dynamic sport that has captured the hearts of fans around the world. Played on
            a rectangular court by two teams of five players each, the objective is to score points by shooting the ball
            through the opposing team’s hoop, which stands 10 feet high. The game is known for its fluid movement,
            strategic plays, and electrifying moments.

            Players are typically assigned positions based on their skills, including point guard, shooting guard, small
            forward, power forward, and center, each with unique roles that contribute to the team’s success.
            Offensively, teams execute plays such as pick-and-rolls and fast breaks, while defensively they employ
            strategies like man-to-man coverage or zone defense.
